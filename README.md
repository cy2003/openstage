# README

OpenStage is the best place for venues and performers to find each other. It is OpenTable for venues and artists. 

In this app, venues post time slots that they are looking to fill with performers. Artists complete profiles that include experience and traction (on Spotify or elsewhere) and they submit requests for open time slots. Venues (managed by promoters or venue owners) use the in-app information to select the best fit for each time slot.

This app is initially targeted at small venues, bars and cafes with the vision to expand into larger venues.

OpenStage was created as a project for the full-stack web developer course at the [Flatiron School](https://flatironschool.com/). The project utilizes [[Rails and Active Record](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html) and [PostGres database](https://www.postgresql.org/). 


## Install
To launch the app:

```
bundle install
rake db:create
rake db:migrate
rake db:seed
rails s

```
The PostGres database needs to be running in your local environment for this app to function. Soon we will move to a 3rd party hosting site (Heroku).
